SPIFlashDMA
===========

An experimental DMA-SPI based driver for Flash Chip

This library has been developed by henning karlsen <br>
http://www.henningkarlsen.com/electronics/library.php?id=65<br>
The version here is just an experiment to test SPI-DMA of Teensy3 and should not be used since it will work(!?) ONLY on Teensy3
If you want an OFFICIAL working version of this library, follow link above!<br>
The library it's here just for discussion about implement SPI-DMA stuff on Teensy3.<br><br>

*** Note about current version.<br>
This current version works only with Teensy3 and SPI_Transactions as start, I will add the DMA stuff later. The purpose it's test the differences between normal SPI calls and DMA ones https://github.com/crteensy/DmaSpi
